This situation makes it nearly impossible for all  stakeholders to engage in the conversation productively. The result is linear  and incremental policy development, particularly for low-income countries,  where governments often do not have the resources to afford expensive consultants.</p> <p>To solve this problem, we plan to build an open-source energy transition data  platform without usability compromises and partner with organisations and  initiatives that help scale our user growth. More specifically, our strategy  is to take the most promising open-source frameworks and:  Improve the quality and quantity of their input files, Reduce usability compromises by modernising the data stack, and Create a network effect by partnering with users on both sides of the climate  finance ledger.</p> <p>We intend to utilise OSeMOSYS and PyPSA, which are already among the most  widely used open-source energy modelling frameworks. For example, these  frameworks have been copied by well-known consultancies and initiatives  (e.g., McKinsey, UN PRI), used as a core planning tool for several governments  (e.g., Cyprus, Costa Rica, Bolivia), and incorporated into major technical  assistance initiatives (e.g., UN DESA and CCG Programme).</p>"},{"location":"esmod/","title":"Esmod","text":"<p>This is the 'About' page</p>"},{"location":"feo-api/","title":"API","text":"<pre><code>code goes here\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/","title":"Data Catalog","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#generation","title":"Generation","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#prices","title":"Prices","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#assets","title":"Assets","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#policy","title":"Policy","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#technologies","title":"Technologies","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#potentials-rename","title":"Potentials (rename)","text":""},{"location":"feo-data-catalog/#profiles-rename","title":"Profiles (rename)","text":""},{"location":"feo-python-client/","title":"Python Client","text":"<pre><code>code goes here\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"feo-python-client/#installation","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"feo-python-client/#quickstart","title":"Quickstart","text":""},{"location":"feo-python-client/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"feo-python-client/#examples","title":"Examples","text":""},{"location":"feo-esmod-osemosys/docs/","title":"FEO Global (OSeMOSYS)","text":"<p>'Future Energy Outlook' (FEO) is an open source electricity system model generator with global coverage.
