To date, products to support energy transition planning are often based on 
closed data and models. This situation makes it nearly impossible for all 
stakeholders to engage in the conversation productively. The result is linear 
and incremental policy development, particularly for low-income countries, 
where governments often do not have the resources to afford expensive consultants.

To solve this problem, we plan to build an open-source energy transition data 
platform without usability compromises and partner with organisations and 
initiatives that help scale our user growth. More specifically, our strategy 
is to take the most promising open-source frameworks and: 
Improve the quality and quantity of their input files,
Reduce usability compromises by modernising the data stack, and
Create a network effect by partnering with users on both sides of the climate 
finance ledger.

We intend to utilise OSeMOSYS and PyPSA, which are already among the most 
widely used open-source energy modelling frameworks. For example, these 
frameworks have been copied by well-known consultancies and initiatives 
(e.g., McKinsey, UN PRI), used as a core planning tool for several governments 
(e.g., Cyprus, Costa Rica, Bolivia), and incorporated into major technical 
assistance initiatives (e.g., UN DESA and CCG Programme).
