# Indonesia

The first application of FEO Global is the development of an openly available 
electricity systems model for Indonesia. This model is used to explore 
transition pathways to a net-zero electricity system. As with all energy system 
models, the inputs include a range of datasets and assumptions (e.g. technology 
cost projections, discount rates). All of these inputs are described here in 
order to allow for the model to be reviewed, re-run, and re-purposed.

## Model scope


The model aims to represent the electricity system of Indonesia as accurately as
possible, subject to constraints on data and computation time. The main aspects 
that improve the accuracy of the model's representation of Indonesia's 
electricity system are its spatial and temporal resolution.


### Spatial resolution

The model represents all 34 provinces of Indonesia across 7 regions - shown in 
the table and map below - as individual nodes.

### Temporal resolution

Each year is divided into 2 'Seasons' [S1-S6]: 

{{ read_csv('./tables/seasons_summary.csv') }}

Each 'Season' is further divided into 6 'Daily Time Brackets':

{{ read_csv('./tables/dailytimebrackets_summary.csv') }}

Together, there are 12 representative 'timeslices' in the model. The temporal 
resolution is the same for the entire model period. 


### Model horizon

**Base year** - 2021

**End year** - 2050


## Key assumptions

### Discount rates

The model includes two types of discount rates (DR): 'social' and 'financial'. 
The social DR is applied across the entire model and represents the relative 
weighting of present and future costs and benefits. A low social DR weights the 
present and the future more similarly than a high DR. The financial DR is 
technology-specific and represents the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 
for a given technology (e.g. power plant). The model assumes a value of 
**10%** for both the social and financial discount rates. The latter is based 
on the [IEA Cost of Capital Observatory](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/cost-of-capital-observatory). 


### Reserve Margin

The Reserve margin decreases from the current level of 60% to 35% by 2030, based
on [RUPTL 2021-2030](https://web.pln.co.id/statics/uploads/2021/10/ruptl-2021-2030.pdf).


## Data

Below is a summary of all the input data used in the model.

### Technology costs

Battery costs from [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79236.pdf). 
All other costs from [OSeMOSYS Global](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01737-0)
and [PLEXOS World](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/PLEXOS-World).

### Renewable Energy Profiles

Hourly renewable energy profiles for wind (onshore and offshore) and solar PV 
in each province were obtained from [renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/).
Data for 2020 was used.


### Renewable Energy Potentials

Data on renewable energy potentials by province was obtained from multiple 
sources:

- Geothermal: ['Volcanostratigraphy of Batukuwung-Parakasak Geothermal Area, Serang Regency, West Java', U. Sumotarto, 2019](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1363/1/012048) 
- Solar PV: ['Beyond 443 GW - Indonesia's Infinite Renewable Energy Potentials', IESR, 2021](https://iesr.or.id/en/pustaka/beyond-443-gw-indonesias-infinite-renewable-energy-potentials)
- Wind: ['Beyond 443 GW - Indonesia's Infinite Renewable Energy Potentials', IESR, 2021](https://iesr.or.id/en/pustaka/beyond-443-gw-indonesias-infinite-renewable-energy-potentials)

### Electricity demand projections

Electricity demands for all 34 provinces, current and projected, are inputs to 
the model. Electricity demand by province for 2021 is obtained from the [RUPTL 2021-2030](https://web.pln.co.id/statics/uploads/2021/10/ruptl-2021-2030.pdf). The methodology used to project these 
demands between 2021-2050 is detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P9va-0Nhl3Tfr68iV4I5B9J3yA1qSakN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100957394761881350527&rtpof=true&sd=true) and summarised below.
