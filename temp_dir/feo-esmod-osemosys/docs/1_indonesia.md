# Indonesia

The first application of FEO Global is the development of an openly available 
electricity systems model for Indonesia. This model is used to explore 
transition pathways to a net-zero electricity system. As with all energy system 
models, the inputs include a range of datasets and assumptions (e.g. technology 
cost projections, discount rates). All of these inputs are described here in 
order to allow for the model to be reviewed, re-run, and re-purposed.

## Model scope

The model aims to represent the electricity system of Indonesia as accurately as
possible, subject to constraints on data and computation time. The main aspects 
that improve the accuracy of the model's representation of Indonesia's 
electricity system are its spatial and temporal resolution.

### Spatial resolution

The model represents all 34 provinces of Indonesia across 7 regions - shown in 
the table and map below - as individual nodes.
